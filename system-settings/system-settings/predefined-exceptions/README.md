# Predefined Exceptions

_**Predefined Exceptions**_ is the screen where the exceptions expected in the system are predefined. These exceptions, defined as Warning/Failed/Error/Succes, are searched in the customer's log file.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_As an example, if xxx.abc.yyException is defined as Error, the system will recognize it as a system error and will not reflect it in the test results.  Exceptions specified for failed cases are displayed in the test results._&#x20;

_Basically, this definition is for adding values to match the error/fail/success results that need to be known in the log file._
{% endhint %}
